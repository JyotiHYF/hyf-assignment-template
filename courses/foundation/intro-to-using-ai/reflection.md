### 1. Three new things I learned from AI

I learned how to use JavaScript to change the background color dynamically, how to make a simple responsive layout with media queries, and how to add smooth transitions in CSS. I also learned how to keep my code organized by linking separate CSS and JS files.

### 2. Where I had to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions

I adjusted some of Copilot’s suggested CSS values, like the font sizes and padding, to make the layout more visually balanced. I also refined the JavaScript color generator to use HSL values for softer colors.

### 3. Difference between using Copilot to generate code vs. as a learning partner

Using Copilot to generate code can save time, but using it as a learning partner helps you understand _why_ the code works. As a learning partner, AI can explain concepts and guide you to experiment rather than just providing answers.

### 4. Three risks of relying too much on AI tools

- You might not fully understand the code you’re writing.
- Your problem-solving skills could weaken if you depend on AI suggestions too often.
- It can be easy to miss errors or inefficient code if you trust AI outputs without reviewing them carefully.

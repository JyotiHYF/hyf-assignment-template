**1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.**
I learned how to link separate CSS and JavaScript files to an HTML page.
I discovered how to use JavaScript to generate random colors dynamically.
I also learned how to use media queries to make a web page responsive.
**2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?**
I adjusted the layout and color scheme to better fit my personal style.
I simplified the JavaScript code Copilot suggested to make it easier to understand.
I also improved the responsive behavior so it looks good on both desktop and mobile.
**3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?**
Using Copilot to generate code saves time but doesn’t help you understand the logic behind it.
Using it as a learning partner means reviewing and modifying the code it suggests, which builds real skills.
It’s about collaboration — letting Copilot assist while you stay in control of the learning.
**4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.**
You might stop thinking critically about how the code works.
It could make debugging and problem-solving harder in the long term.
You might miss important learning moments by accepting AI-generated solutions too quickly.

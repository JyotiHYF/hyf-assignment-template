1. Where is the recipe data stored?
   ->The recipe data is stored in a Database.
     Examples of databases you could use:
     SQL 
    The database keeps:
    Recipe title.
    Ingredients.

2. How does the frontend communicate with the backend?
  ->The frontend (UI) communicates with the backend using HTTP requests over an API.
Examples:
     GET /recipes → fetch all recipes
     GET /recipes/:id → fetch a single recipe
     POST /recipes → add a recipe
     PUT /recipes/:id → update a recipe
     DELETE /recipes/:id → delete a recipe
Communication flow:
Frontend → Backend → Database → Backend → Frontend
The backend processes the request, interacts with the database, and returns a response (data or success message).

3. What happens when a user adds a new recipe?
    -Here is the step-by-step flow:
    -User Action
    -The user fills in recipe details (title, ingredients, instructions).
    -They click "Add Recipe".
Frontend
    -The frontend collects the recipe data.
    -It sends an HTTP POST request to the backend:
POST /recipes with the recipe JSON data.
Backend->
     -The backend receives the POST request.
    -It validates the recipe data.
      It creates a new recipe object.
      It saves the recipe to the database.
Database
       The database stores the recipe.
       It returns the newly created recipe record to the backend.
Backend → Frontend
       The backend sends a response:
       201 Created + recipe data
Frontend->
The UI updates to show the new recipe.
A success message is displayed.

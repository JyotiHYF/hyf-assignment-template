        <p>
          This space is for stillness — for learning to be kind to yourself, to
          rest without guilt, and to heal without rushing. You deserve gentle
          care, even on your hardest days.

          <h3>🌤 Self-Compassion on Heavy Days</h3>
          <p>
            Some mornings, just getting out of bed feels like a victory. Those
            are the days that need softness — not pressure. Let the world move
            without you for a while. You’re still enough.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “You are allowed to be both a masterpiece and a work in progress.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Breathe. Wrap yourself in something warm. Speak to yourself as you
            would to a friend. Healing doesn’t happen faster just because you
            force it — it blooms when you let it.

          <h3>🍵 Letting Go of Productivity Guilt</h3>
          <p>
            We’ve been taught that our worth comes from what we do. But
            sometimes, doing less is the bravest thing. Rest is not laziness —
            it’s a quiet act of self-respect.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="quote">
            “You are not behind. You are breathing, learning, and becoming.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Give yourself permission to rest. Let your body and mind recharge.
            There is no finish line — only moments to be lived fully, softly,
            one breath at a time.
